Home to the new Kevinbot v3 Desktop Client. This is intended to be a replacement for the [Remote](https://github.com/meowmeowahr/KevinbotV3-Remote).

Drive and operate Kevinbot using a regular PC, gaming controllers, and a USB-connected XBee. Get rid of the need for custom, hard to debug, and slow Raspberry Pi hardware.

## Features

* Modern PySide6 GUI with dark theme
* pyglet backend for controllers
* Support Escaped/Unescaped XBee API modes
* Support all XBee-supported baud rates and flow control
* Unit and coverage testing
* Cross-platform compatibility (Mac support hasn't been tested)
* GNU GPLv3 license
